# Web-Design-Challenge: Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)
For this homework I was required to create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I created in the python-api-challenge homework (https://github.com/bjwlknsn/python-api-challenge).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where the data used to build them can be viewed.

The website was deployed to GitHub pages and is located here: https://bjwlknsn.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html
